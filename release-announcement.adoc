7.0.0.Alpha1 is the first development release of the Hibernate 7.0 family which includes many new features, in addition to many improvements and fixes.


[[jpa-32]]
== Jakarta Persistence 3.2

7.0 migrates to Jakarta Persistence 3.2 which can be fairly disruptive.  See the link:{migration-guide-url}#jpa-32[Migration Guide] for details.


[[java-17]]
== Java 17

Version 3.2 of Jakarta Persistence requires Java 17.  Hibernate 7.0 therefore baselines on Java 17 whereas previous versions baseline on Java 11.


[[mapping-xml]]
== mapping.xsd

Hibernate 7.0 provides a new XSD that represents an "extension" of the Jakarta Persistence orm.xsd weaving in Hibernate-specific mapping features.  The namespace for this extended mapping is `http://www.hibernate.org/xsd/orm/mapping`


[[hibernate-models]]
== Hibernate Models

7.0 migrates from https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-commons-annotations/[Hibernate Commons Annotations] (HCANN) to the new https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-models[Hibernate Models] project for low-level processing of an application domain model, reading annotations and weaving in XML mapping documents.

See the link:{migration-guide-url}#hibernate-models[Migration Guide] for details.


[[model-validations]]
== Domain Model Validations

7.0 does much more validation of an application's domain model and especially its mapping details, e.g.

* illegal combinations such as `@Basic` and `@ManyToOne` on the same attribute
* misplaced annotations such as an annotated getter method with FIELD access
* stricter following of JavaBean conventions

See the link:{migration-guide-url}#annotation-validation[Migration Guide] for details.
